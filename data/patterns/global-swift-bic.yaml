      Financial terminology appearing in published reports, accounting textbooks, regulatory guidance, or template

      identifiers to confirm actual sensitive data.

      In English (as the primary international business language), standard business terminology overlapping with
      financial detection keywords in routine correspondence and documentation.

      Increase confidence threshold when scanning business correspondence. Layer with transaction-specific patterns for
      higher precision.
