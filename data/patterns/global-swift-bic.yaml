description: >-
  Detects Swift Bic patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9362 Corroborative evidence: 9 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword
  lists: financial-bank-account.
pattern: \b[A-Z]{6}[A-Z0-9]{2}([A-Z0-9]{3})?\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: structurally constrained pattern with corroborative keyword support reduces false positive rates
  significantly.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Financial terminology appearing in published reports, accounting textbooks, regulatory guidance, or template
      documents without actual transaction data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window. Cross-reference with structured financial
      identifiers to confirm actual sensitive data.
  - description: >-
      In English (as the primary international business language), standard business terminology overlapping with
      financial detection keywords in routine correspondence and documentation.
    mitigation: >-
      Increase confidence threshold when scanning business correspondence. Layer with transaction-specific patterns for
      higher precision.
