description: >-
  Detects Azure publish settings file password patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive
  information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a
  starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Matches password attributes in Azure .publishsettings XML files, which contain management certificate credentials for
  Azure subscription access. Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: credentials-api-keys.
pattern: (?i)(ManagementCertificate|userPWD|publishPassword)\s*=\s*"?[A-Za-z0-9+/]{40,}={0,2}"?
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: structurally constrained pattern matching publish settings credentials with specific XML attribute
  context reduces false positive rates significantly.

      Expired or rotated publish settings files that no longer grant access.
    mitigation: >-
      Flag for review regardless since the file format reveals subscription details.
