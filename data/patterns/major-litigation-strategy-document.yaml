description: 'Detects privileged litigation strategy documents for matters with significant financial exposure (>$10M) or
  systemic policy impact. These documents reveal the State''s assessment of its own weaknesses, settlement authority, and
  tactical approach. Note: trainable classifier recommended for production deployment using document structural features.'
operation: 'Primary detection: keyword proximity matching litigation strategy terms (''litigation strategy'', ''case strategy'',
  ''trial strategy'', ''defence strategy'') within 200 characters of privilege indicators (''privileged'', ''LPP'', ''confidential'',
  ''PROTECTED''). Trainable classifier fallback: structural headings detection for ''Strengths/Weaknesses'', ''Prospects of
  Success'', ''Risk Assessment'', ''Recommended Approach'' combined with privilege markings. Corroborative evidence: 3 keywords
  within 300 characters.'

confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: Litigation strategy terminology combined with privilege markers is specific to
  active privileged legal work product. Trainable classifier component further reduces false positives by matching document
  structure typical of strategy documents.'
