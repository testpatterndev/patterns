type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects Unique Student Identifier (USI) patterns. A 10-character alphanumeric code (uppercase letters and digits)
  mandatory since January 2023 for higher education in Australia.
operation: >-
  Regex pattern using universal engine. The top-level regex \b[A-Z0-9]{10}\b matches exactly 10 uppercase
  alphanumeric characters. The Purview engine uses two regexes: Pattern_usi_labeled (labeled format with USI/Unique
  Student Identifier/student identifier prefix + 10 alphanumeric chars) and Pattern_au_usi (bare 10-char format).
  Three confidence tiers: High (85) requires USI terms + education context keywords with template exclusion logic;
  Medium (75) requires USI terms + education context keywords; Low (65) requires USI terms only. Evidence uses 2
  keyword groups (7 USI terms, 13 education context terms) within 300-character proximity. Keyword lists:
  au-identity-usi, industry-education.
pattern: \b[A-Z0-9]{10}\b
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: a 10-character uppercase alphanumeric pattern is extremely broad and will match tracking numbers,
  serial codes, product IDs, and many other identifiers. Corroborative evidence keywords such as USI, student
  identifier, or TAFE are essential for reliable detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to unique student identifier appearing in policy documents, training materials,
      HR templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
