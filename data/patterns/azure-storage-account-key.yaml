description: >-
  Detects Azure Storage account key patterns outside of full connection strings. This pattern is based on a Microsoft
  Purview built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT
  directly, or use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Matches standalone Azure Storage account keys, which are 88-character Base64-encoded strings. This pattern detects
  keys that appear outside of a complete connection string format. Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords within 300
  characters. Keyword lists: credentials-api-keys.
pattern: \b[A-Za-z0-9+/]{86,88}={0,2}\b
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: generic Base64 pattern that may match other encoded data. Corroborative evidence keywords are essential
  for reliable detection.
