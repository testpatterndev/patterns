version: 2.0.0
type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Identifies electronic mail addresses in RFC-compatible local-part@domain.tld format. Requires valid
  top-level domain of 2+ characters. Uses word-boundary anchoring distinct from substring matching.
operation: >-
  Regex matching email addresses with alphanumeric local part, @ separator, domain with dot-separated
  labels, and TLD of 2+ characters. Corroborative evidence: 3 tiers with correspondence-label and
  context keywords within 300 characters.
pattern: \b[a-zA-Z0-9._%+\-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.\-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: the @ symbol with domain.tld structure is distinctive to email addresses.
  TLD validation eliminates most non-email @ usage.
