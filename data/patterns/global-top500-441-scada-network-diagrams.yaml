name: SCADA network diagrams
slug: global-top500-441-scada-network-diagrams
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies documents containing references to scada network diagrams in international contexts. This information type
  is classified as personally identifiable information under applicable data protection regulations.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors with proximity constraints to match
  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 7 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: pii-contact,
  industry-critical-infrastructure, infrastructure-industrial-protocols.
pattern: (?is)\b(scada|supervisory\s+control\s+and\s+data\s+acquisition)\b.{0,220}\b(network\s+diagram|topology|rtu)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: structural regex with domain-specific anchors and constrained context replaces phrase-only marker.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to scada network diagrams appearing in policy documents, training materials, HR
      templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In English (as the primary international business language), similar terminology used in formal or administrative
      contexts (education, professional documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
