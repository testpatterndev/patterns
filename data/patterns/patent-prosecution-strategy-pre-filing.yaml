description: 'Detects legal strategy for patent prosecution before filing, including prior art assessments, claim drafting
  strategy, and freedom-to-operate opinions. Disclosure destroys patent novelty or reveals prosecution strategy to competitors.
  Note: trainable classifier recommended for production deployment.'
operation: 'Primary detection: keyword proximity matching patent terms (''patent'', ''patent prosecution'', ''patent application'',
  ''patent strategy'') within 200 characters of pre-filing indicators (''pre-filing'', ''draft claims'', ''prior art'', ''freedom
  to operate'', ''FTO'', ''novelty'', ''privilege'', ''PROTECTED'', ''CONFIDENTIAL''). Exclusion: published patents by negative
  match on ''granted'', ''published'', ''PCT publication''. Corroborative evidence: 3 keywords within 300 characters.'

confidence_justification: 'High confidence: Patent + pre-filing/draft claims + privilege indicators targets unpublished patent
  strategy. Exclusion of granted/published patents eliminates the vast majority of public patent documents.'
