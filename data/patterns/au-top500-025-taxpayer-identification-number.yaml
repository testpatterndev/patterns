pattern: \btaxpayer\s+identification\s+number\b
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence marker: phrase-based artifact detection to bootstrap line-by-line coverage. Requires corroborative
  evidence and later hardening to high-confidence structural patterns.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to taxpayer identification number appearing in policy documents, training
      materials, HR templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
