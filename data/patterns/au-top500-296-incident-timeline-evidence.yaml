name: Incident timeline evidence
slug: au-top500-296-incident-timeline-evidence
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies incident timeline evidence patterns in security and access control contexts. Detects potential exposure of
  sensitive security information in Australian systems.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses word-boundary phrase matching with flexible whitespace.
  Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords within 300 characters.
pattern: (?is)\b(?:incident\s+timeline|timeline\s+of\s+events|event\s+timeline)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: structural regex with domain-specific anchors and constrained context replaces phrase-only marker.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Authentication-related terminology in software documentation, security training materials, or system architecture
      descriptions without actual credentials.
    mitigation: >-
      Require proximity to credential-specific patterns (API keys, connection strings, tokens) rather than general
      security terminology.
  - description: >-
      Code snippets and configuration examples containing credential-related keywords or placeholder values in developer
      documentation.
    mitigation: >-
      Check for common placeholder patterns (example.com, localhost, 0000) and documentation file types to reduce false
      positives from technical writing.
