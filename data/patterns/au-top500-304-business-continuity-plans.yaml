name: Business continuity plans
slug: au-top500-304-business-continuity-plans
version: 1.1.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies business continuity plans patterns in security and access control contexts. Detects potential exposure of
  sensitive security information in Australian systems.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Three-tier purview detection: high confidence (95) matches business
  continuity pattern with BCP component evidence and template exclusion; medium confidence (85) matches with BCP
  component plus crisis management evidence; low confidence (75) matches with IT operations evidence. Corroborative
  evidence: 6 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: industry-education.
pattern: '(?i)\b(?:business\s+continuity\s+(?:plan|management|program)|bcp\s+(?:document|plan|procedures?)|continuity\s+of\s+(?:operations?|business)\s+plan)\b'
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: category-aware structural regex with anchor and context constraints replaces phrase-only detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Authentication-related terminology in software documentation, security training materials, or system architecture
      descriptions without actual credentials.
    mitigation: >-
      Require proximity to credential-specific patterns (API keys, connection strings, tokens) rather than general
      security terminology.
  - description: >-
      Code snippets and configuration examples containing credential-related keywords or placeholder values in developer
      documentation.
    mitigation: >-
      Check for common placeholder patterns (example.com, localhost, 0000) and documentation file types to reduce false
      positives from technical writing.
