description: >-
  Identifies documents containing references to probation and parole files in international contexts. This information
  type is classified as personally identifiable information under applicable data protection regulations.

pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(mugshot|informant|investigation|intercept|surveillance|dna|probation|parole|plea|victim|evidence)\b.{0,220}\b(record|file|note|transcript|report|log|statement)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: category-aware structural regex with anchor and context constraints replaces phrase-only detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to probation and parole files appearing in policy documents, training materials,

    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In English (as the primary international business language), similar terminology used in formal or administrative
      contexts (education, professional documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
