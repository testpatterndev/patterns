engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sit-defn-philippines-national-identification-number Corroborative evidence: 4 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: pii-civic-credentials.
pattern: \b\d{4}-\d{7}-\d{1}\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: pattern has strong structural constraints (specific format, prefix, or character class restrictions) that significantly reduce false positive rates.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      The specific dash-separated format (XXXX-XXXXXXX-X) significantly reduces false positives.
    mitigation: >-
      The structured format provides strong inherent validation. Keyword context further improves accuracy.
  - description: >-
      In multiple languages, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
