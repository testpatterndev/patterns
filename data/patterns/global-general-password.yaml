type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects general password patterns in documents and configuration files. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview
  built-in sensitive information type. In Purview, this is a broad, function-based detector. This keyword-based version
  flags documents that may contain passwords for further review.
operation: >-
  Matches documents containing password assignments in common formats including configuration files, code, and documents.
  This is a wide-scope detector intended for broad classification rather than precise detection.
pattern: (?i)\b(password|passwd|pwd|pass)\s*[:=]\s*"?[^\s"']{6,}"?
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: broad keyword-based detection that will match password-related terminology in documentation, code
  comments, and non-sensitive contexts. Intended as a wide-net classifier.

  - description: >-
      Source code containing password parameter names and function arguments without actual credential values.
    mitigation: >-
      Verify that the value following the keyword appears to be an actual credential.
