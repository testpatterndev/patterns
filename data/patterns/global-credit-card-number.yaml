description: >-
  Detects credit and debit card numbers across all major payment networks including Visa, Mastercard, American Express,
  Diners Club, Discover, and JCB. This broad pattern covers the full range of IIN/BIN prefixes defined by ISO/IEC 7812
  and is intended for global PCI-DSS compliance scanning where complete network coverage is required.

confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  Each card network has a well-defined prefix range and fixed length, providing strong structural constraints. The
  pattern covers all six major networks with precise prefix matching. Luhn algorithm validation as a post-match step
  eliminates nearly all remaining false positives.

      coincidentally start with a valid card prefix
    mitigation: >-
      Always validate matched values with the Luhn algorithm. Require at least one corroborative evidence keyword within
      the configured proximity window.
