description: >-
  Detects Credit Card Number patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in
  sensitive information type. Financial account numbers require corroborative evidence for
  reliable detection due to their generic numeric format.
operation: >-
  Corroborative evidence: 7 keywords within 300 characters.
  Keyword lists: credit-card, payment-card.
pattern: '\b(?:4\d{3}|5[1-5]\d{2}|3[47]\d{2}|6011)\d{4}\d{4}\d{1,4}\b'
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: credit card numbers have distinctive prefix patterns (Visa 4xxx, Mastercard 51-55xx, Amex 34/37xx, Discover 6011) combined with Luhn check digit validation that make them highly identifiable.

      or postal code formats.
