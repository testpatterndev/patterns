description: Detects documents containing the identities of police informants (confidential human sources) embedded within
  criminal organisations. Informant identity is the single most sensitive category of law enforcement information globally.
  Disclosure has historically resulted in murders and creates immediate lethal risk.
operation: 'Keyword proximity: primary keywords (confidential human source, registered informant, source handler, source controller,
  CHIS, informant registration) within 300 characters of personal identifiers and handler references. Document markers for
  QPS source registration systems and source reference numbers. Negative keyword exclusion for policy and media contexts.'

confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: confidential human source management terminology is highly specialised and rarely
  appears outside genuine law enforcement source handling records. The co-occurrence of CHIS terminology with handler references
  and source registration numbers is distinctive.'
