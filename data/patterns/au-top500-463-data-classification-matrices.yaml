name: Data classification matrices
slug: au-top500-463-data-classification-matrices
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies documents containing references to data classification matrices in Australian contexts. This information
  type is classified as personally identifiable information under applicable data protection regulations.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors with proximity constraints to match
  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 7 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists:
  classification-australia-government, classification-corporate.
pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(data\s+inventory|classification|retention|deletion|impact\s+assessment|cross-border|contractual\s+clause|privacy\s+complaint|audit|compliance)\b.{0,220}\b(matrix|schedule|assessment|report|file|response|output)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: category-aware structural regex with anchor and context constraints replaces phrase-only detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to data classification matrices appearing in policy documents, training
      materials, HR templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
