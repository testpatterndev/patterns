description: Detects documents containing intelligence holdings, surveillance methods, evidence gaps, and investigative strategy
  against active criminal investigation targets. These target packages reveal the full picture of what police know and do
  not know about a suspect, enabling counter-surveillance and evidence destruction if disclosed.
operation: 'Keyword proximity: primary keywords (target package, target profile, person of interest, investigation target,
  intelligence assessment) within 300 characters of operational planning terms (surveillance plan, intercept, controlled operation,
  task force). Trainable classifier fallback recommended for QPS intelligence assessment templates. Negative keyword exclusion
  for media and academic contexts.'

confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: requires co-occurrence of intelligence assessment terminology with suspect identifiers
  and operational planning language. The density of co-occurring law enforcement intelligence terms within a document distinguishes
  genuine target packages from academic or media references to investigation concepts.'
