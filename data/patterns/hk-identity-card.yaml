type: regex
engine: universal
description: Detects 香港身份證 patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview
  built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to
  enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: 'Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sit-defn-hong-kong-identity-card-number
  Corroborative evidence: 4 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: pii-civic-credentials.
  Uses additional domain-context evidence and explicit exclusion logic for template/sample/test
  text.'
pattern: \b[A-Z]{1,2}\d{6}\([0-9A]\)
confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: pattern has strong structural constraints
  (specific format, prefix, or character class restrictions) that significantly reduce
  false positive rates. Added context gating and exclusion rules improve precision
  and reduce incidental matches.'

    description: Too few digits (5 instead of 6)

    description: Three prefix letters (too many)
  - value: template example placeholder record identifier
    description: Template/sample context should be excluded even when anchor words
      are present
false_positives:
- description: The distinctive format with parenthesized check digit is relatively
    specific but may appear in formatted reference numbers.
  mitigation: The structured format with parenthesized check digit provides strong
    validation. Keyword context further improves accuracy.
- description: In multiple languages, similar terminology used in formal or administrative
    contexts (education, professional documentation) that does not constitute sensitive
    data collection.
  mitigation: Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers,
    form fields, or database column headers to distinguish sensitive records from
    general references.
