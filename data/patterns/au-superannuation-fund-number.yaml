type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects Australian Superannuation Fund Number (RSE) patterns. An R prefix followed by 7 digits, registered with
  APRA.
operation: >-
  Regex pattern using universal engine. The top-level regex \bR\d{7}\b matches an uppercase R followed by exactly 7
  digits. The Purview engine uses two regexes: Pattern_super_labeled (labeled format with RSE/fund/APRA/superannuation
  prefix + R + digits) and Pattern_au_super_fund (bare R + 7 digits format). Three confidence tiers: High (85)
  requires superannuation terms + payroll/retirement keywords with template exclusion logic; Medium (75) requires
  superannuation terms; Low (65) requires superannuation terms only (minimum context). Evidence uses 2 keyword groups
  (9 superannuation terms, 9 payroll/retirement terms) within 300-character proximity. Keyword lists:
  financial-deposit-terms, industry-hr.
pattern: \bR\d{7}\b
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: an R followed by 7 digits is a relatively short pattern that can match reference codes, part
  numbers, and other alphanumeric sequences. Corroborative evidence keywords such as superannuation, APRA, or RSE are
  essential for reliable detection.
