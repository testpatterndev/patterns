schema: testpattern/v1
name: Immigration file number
slug: au-top500-031-immigration-file-number
version: 1.1.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: Identifies documents containing references to immigration file number
  in Australian contexts. This information type is classified as personally identifiable
  information under the Privacy Act 1988.
operation: 'Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors
  with proximity constraints to match domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence:
  8 keywords within 300 characters. Uses additional domain-context evidence and explicit
  exclusion logic for template/sample/test text.'
pattern: (?is)\b(?:immigration\s+file\s+number|id|identifier|number|no\.?|reference|record)\b\s{0,80}\b[A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9\-/
  ]{4,24}\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: identifier/document-structure anchored regex with constrained
  context replaces phrase-only detection. Added context gating and exclusion rules
  improve precision and reduce incidental matches.

  should_match:
  - value: Immigration file number
    description: Exact phrase marker match
  - value: immigration file number
    description: Case-insensitive phrase match
  - value: Immigration file number
    description: Normalized whitespace phrase
  - value: structured record with identifier and contextual anchors
    description: Structural anchor sample
  should_not_match:
  - value: unrelated generic text
    description: No relevant phrase context
  - value: placeholder value 12345
    description: Random text should not match phrase marker
  - value: generic narrative without identifier/document anchors
    description: Should not match plain mention
  - value: template example placeholder record identifier
    description: Template/sample context should be excluded even when anchor words
      are present
false_positives:
- description: Common words and phrases related to immigration file number appearing
    in policy documents, training materials, HR templates, or compliance guidelines
    without actual personal data.
  mitigation: Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window
    to confirm sensitive data context rather than general discussion.
- description: In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative
    contexts (education, professional documentation) that does not constitute sensitive
    data collection.
  mitigation: Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers,
    form fields, or database column headers to distinguish sensitive records from
    general references.
- description: High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad
    regex anchors. Expected match rate is significantly higher than specific identifier
    patterns.
  mitigation: Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern
    primarily as a pre-filter with secondary validation.
