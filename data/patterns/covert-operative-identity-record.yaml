description: Detects documents containing the true identities of undercover law enforcement officers deployed within criminal
  organisations. These records link assumed identities (legends) to real identities and are among the most life-critical records
  in law enforcement. Disclosure directly endangers the lives of deployed operatives and destroys years of infiltration work.
operation: 'Keyword proximity: primary keywords (covert operative, undercover officer, assumed identity, legend identity,
  cover identity) within 300 characters of corroborative keywords (PROTECTED, Law-Enforcement, QPS, operative deployment,
  personnel number). Document marker detection for QPS classification headers. Negative keyword exclusion for media, fiction,
  and training contexts.'
pattern: (?i)\b(covert\s+operative|undercover\s+officer|assumed\s+identity|legend\s+identity|cover\s+identity|operative\s+deployment|undercover\s+deployment)\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: requires co-occurrence of multiple law enforcement identity management terms within
  proximity of classification markers and personnel identifiers. Single keyword matches are insufficient; the pattern requires
  document-level context indicating an actual operational record rather than a policy discussion or news article.'
