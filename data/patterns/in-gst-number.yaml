description: >-
  Detects India GST Number patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in
  sensitive information type. Due to the numeric format, corroborative evidence keywords
  are essential for reliable detection.
operation: >-
  Corroborative evidence: 5 keywords within 300 characters.
  Keyword lists: gst, in-financial.
pattern: '\b\d{2}[A-Z]{5}\d{4}[A-Z]\d[A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9]\b'
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: the GSTIN format with 2-digit state code, 5-letter PAN, and structured suffix is highly distinctive and unlikely to appear in non-GST contexts.

    mitigation: >-
      Layer with jurisdiction-specific detection to prioritise matches in tax-related documents
      and cross-reference with other identifier types.
