description: Detects documents containing terrorism threat assessments, persons of interest profiles, and counter-terrorism
  operational capabilities. Disclosure enables counter-surveillance by terrorist subjects and compromises national security
  monitoring. Includes JCTT (Joint Counter Terrorism Team) and QPS Security and Counter-Terrorism Group documents.
operation: 'Keyword proximity: primary keywords (counter-terrorism, CT assessment, terrorism threat assessment, national threat
  advisory, foreign fighter, radicalisation assessment, fixated threat) within 300 characters of subject identifiers and intelligence
  assessment language. Document markers from JCTT and QPS SCTG templates. Trainable classifier recommended for CT assessment
  document structure. Negative keyword exclusion for public threat advisories and media.'

confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: requires co-occurrence of counter-terrorism assessment terminology with subject
  identifiers and intelligence classification markers. The combination of CT-specific language with operational detail distinguishes
  genuine assessments from publicly available threat level announcements and media reporting.'
