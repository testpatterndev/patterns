false_positives:

      The specific dash-separated format (XXXX-XXXXXX-X) reduces false positives considerably.
    mitigation: >-
      The structured format provides good inherent validation. Keyword context further improves accuracy.
  - description: >-
      In multiple languages, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
