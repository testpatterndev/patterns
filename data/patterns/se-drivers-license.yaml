type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects Sweden driver's license number patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive
  information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as
  a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Matches 6 digits, an optional hyphen, and 4 digits at word boundaries. Corroborative evidence: 5 keywords within 300
  characters. Keyword lists: pii-government-id.
pattern: \b\d{6}-?\d{4}\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  Medium confidence: pattern has structural constraints but corroborative keywords are recommended to reduce false
  positive rates.
