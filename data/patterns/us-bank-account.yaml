description: >-
  Detects U.S. Bank Account Number patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in
  sensitive information type. Financial account numbers require corroborative evidence for
  reliable detection due to their generic numeric format.
operation: >-
  Corroborative evidence: 6 keywords within 300 characters.
  Keyword lists: banking, us-financial.
pattern: '\b\d{8,17}\b'
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: eight to seventeen digit numbers are extremely common in all contexts. Banking keywords such as 'account number' or 'checking' are essential for reliable US bank account detection.

      financial account numbers from general numeric data.

    mitigation: >-
      Layer with other detection patterns to deprioritise matches that overlap with phone number
      or postal code formats.
