description: >-
  Identifies documents containing references to inspection and enforcement records in Australian contexts. This
  information type is classified as personally identifiable information under the Privacy Act 1988.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors with proximity constraints to match
  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 7 keywords within 300 characters.
pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(?:welfare|housing|child\s+protection|immigration|asylum|permit|licen[cs]e|aid|constituent|registry)\b\s{0,220}\b(?:file|case|determination|application|transcript|narrative|record)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: category-aware structural regex with anchor and context constraints replaces phrase-only detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to inspection and enforcement records appearing in policy documents, training
      materials, HR templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
