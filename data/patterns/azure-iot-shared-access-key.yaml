type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects Azure IoT Hub shared access key patterns outside of connection strings. This pattern is based on a Microsoft
  Purview built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT
  directly, or use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Matches standalone Azure IoT Hub shared access keys, which are Base64-encoded strings. These keys grant access to IoT
  Hub operations. Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: credentials-api-keys.
pattern: (?i)(SharedAccessKey|iot[._-]?key|device[._-]?key|iothub[._-]?key)\s*[:=]\s*"?[A-Za-z0-9+/]{40,50}={0,2}"?
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: structurally constrained Base64 pattern with IoT-specific context keywords reduces false positive
  rates significantly.

      Shared access keys from other Azure services (Service Bus, Event Hubs).
    mitigation: >-
      Use IoT-specific corroborative keywords to differentiate.
