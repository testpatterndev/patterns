engine: universal
description: Detects proprietary trading algorithms, quantitative investment strategies, or systematic risk models used by
  government investment vehicles such as QIC (Queensland Investment Corporation). Keyword-based fallback detection is provided
  for environments without ML classifier support.
operation: 'Trainable classifier (primary): train on documents containing algorithmic trading logic, quantitative strategy
  descriptions, backtesting results, and portfolio construction methodologies. Keyword-based fallback: alpha generation /
  signal / backtest / Sharpe ratio / factor model / systematic / execution algorithm / VWAP / TWAP terms within 300 characters
  of PROTECTED or proprietary markers.'
pattern: null
confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: the combination of quantitative finance terminology (alpha, Sharpe ratio, backtest)
  with proprietary/trade secret markers is highly specific to restricted trading strategy documents. Academic papers discussing
  these concepts are excluded by requiring proprietary context.'
