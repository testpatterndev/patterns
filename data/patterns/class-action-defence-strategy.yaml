  reveal the State''s vulnerability assessment and defence approach for claims potentially affecting thousands of claimants.
  Note: trainable classifier recommended for production using class action document structural features.'
operation: 'Primary detection: keyword proximity matching class action terms (''class action'', ''representative proceeding'',
  ''group proceeding'') within 200 characters of strategy/privilege terms (''defence strategy'', ''legal strategy'', ''privilege'',
  ''PROTECTED'', ''settlement authority'', ''exposure''). Trainable classifier fallback: document structure detection for
  class definition analysis, common questions assessment, opt-out/opt-in strategy, damages modelling. Corroborative evidence:
  3 keywords within 300 characters.'
