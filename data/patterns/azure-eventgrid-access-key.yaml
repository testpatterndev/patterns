description: >-
  Detects Azure Event Grid access key patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive
  information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a
  starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Matches Base64-encoded Event Grid topic or domain access keys used for publishing events. These keys are typically 44
  characters (Base64). Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: credentials-api-keys.
pattern: (?i)(aeg-sas-key|eventgrid[._-]?key|topic[._-]?key)\s*[:=]\s*"?[A-Za-z0-9+/]{40,50}={0,2}"?
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: structurally constrained Base64 pattern with Event Grid context keywords reduces false positive rates
  significantly.

    mitigation: >-
      Use Event Grid specific keywords to differentiate from other services.
