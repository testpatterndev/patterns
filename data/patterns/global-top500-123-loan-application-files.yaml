name: Loan application files
slug: global-top500-123-loan-application-files
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: Detects references to loan application files in financial and compliance
  documents. Commonly found in international regulatory filings, transaction records,
  and audit documentation.
operation: 'Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors
  with proximity constraints to match domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence:
  7 keywords within 300 characters. Uses additional domain-context evidence and explicit
  exclusion logic for template/sample/test text.'
pattern: (?is)\b(?:credit|loan|mortgage|underwriting|kyc|aml|sanction|beneficial\s+owner|policy|claim|premium|reinsurance)\b\s{0,240}\b(?:score|risk|report|application|match|screening|customer|case|financial)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: identifier/document-structure anchored regex with constrained
  context replaces phrase-only detection. Added context gating and exclusion rules
  improve precision and reduce incidental matches.

    description: Exact phrase marker match
  - value: loan application files
    description: Case-insensitive phrase match
  - value: Loan application files
    description: Normalized whitespace phrase
  - value: structured record with identifier and contextual anchors
    description: Structural anchor sample
  should_not_match:
  - value: unrelated generic text
    description: No relevant phrase context
  - value: placeholder value 12345
    description: Random text should not match phrase marker
  - value: generic narrative without identifier/document anchors
    description: Should not match plain mention
  - value: template example placeholder record identifier
    description: Template/sample context should be excluded even when anchor words
      are present
false_positives:
- description: Financial terminology appearing in published reports, accounting textbooks,
    regulatory guidance, or template documents without actual transaction data.
  mitigation: Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window.
    Cross-reference with structured financial identifiers to confirm actual sensitive
    data.
- description: In English (as the primary international business language), standard
    business terminology overlapping with financial detection keywords in routine
    correspondence and documentation.
  mitigation: Increase confidence threshold when scanning business correspondence.
    Layer with transaction-specific patterns for higher precision.
