name: Cryptographic implementation details
slug: global-top500-213-cryptographic-implementation-details
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: Identifies documents containing references to cryptographic implementation
  details in international contexts. This information type is classified as personally
  identifiable information under applicable data protection regulations.
operation: 'Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors
  with proximity constraints to match domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence:
  8 keywords within 300 characters. Uses additional domain-context evidence and explicit
  exclusion logic for template/sample/test text.'
pattern: (?is)\b(?:algorithm|formula|design|prototype|patent|trademark|trade\s+secret|research|dataset|schematic|firmware|model)\b\s{0,220}\b(?:claim|assessment|notebook|inventory|logic|details|manual)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: category-aware structural regex with anchor and context
  constraints replaces phrase-only detection. Added context gating and exclusion rules
  improve precision and reduce incidental matches.

  should_match:
  - value: Cryptographic implementation details
    description: Exact phrase marker match
  - value: cryptographic implementation details
    description: Case-insensitive phrase match
  - value: Cryptographic implementation details
    description: Normalized whitespace phrase
  - value: structured artifact containing anchor terms and contextual fields
    description: Structural anchor sample
  should_not_match:
  - value: unrelated generic text
    description: No relevant phrase context
  - value: placeholder value 12345
    description: Random text should not match phrase marker
  - value: generic prose without structural artifact anchors
    description: Should not match plain mentions
  - value: template example placeholder record identifier
    description: Template/sample context should be excluded even when anchor words
      are present
false_positives:
- description: Common words and phrases related to cryptographic implementation details
    appearing in policy documents, training materials, HR templates, or compliance
    guidelines without actual personal data.
  mitigation: Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window
    to confirm sensitive data context rather than general discussion.
- description: In English (as the primary international business language), similar
    terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
    documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
  mitigation: Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers,
    form fields, or database column headers to distinguish sensitive records from
    general references.
- description: High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad
    regex anchors. Expected match rate is significantly higher than specific identifier
    patterns.
  mitigation: Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern
    primarily as a pre-filter with secondary validation.
