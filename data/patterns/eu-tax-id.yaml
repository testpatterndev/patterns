description: >-
  Detects EU Tax Identification Number (TIN) patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in
  sensitive information type. EU TIN formats vary by member state; this keyword list provides
  tax-related terminology for supplementary matching across EU jurisdictions.
operation: >-
  Function-based detection in Microsoft Purview. This pattern uses keyword matching for
  EU tax identification terminology across multiple member states.

  - taxpayer
  - fiscal code
  - tax number
  - numéro fiscal
  - Steuernummer
  - codice fiscale
