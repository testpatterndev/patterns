name: SIM card identifiers
slug: global-top500-052-sim-card-identifiers
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies documents containing references to sim card identifiers in international contexts. This information type is
  classified as personally identifiable information under applicable data protection regulations.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors with proximity constraints to match
  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 7 keywords within 300 characters.
pattern: (?is)\b(sim\s+card\s+identifiers|id|identifier|number|no\.?|reference|record)\b.{0,80}\b[A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9\-/ ]{4,24}\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: identifier/document-structure anchored regex with constrained context replaces phrase-only detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to sim card identifiers appearing in policy documents, training materials, HR
      templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In English (as the primary international business language), similar terminology used in formal or administrative
      contexts (education, professional documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
