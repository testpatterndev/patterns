  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 7 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists:
  credentials-api-keys, credentials-passwords.
pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(credit|loan|mortgage|underwriting|kyc|aml|sanction|beneficial\s+owner|policy|claim|premium|reinsurance)\b.{0,240}\b(score|risk|report|application|match|screening|customer|case|financial)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: identifier/document-structure anchored regex with constrained context replaces phrase-only detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to tax exemption certificates appearing in policy documents, training materials,

    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
