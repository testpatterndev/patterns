description: >-
  Detects European debit and credit card numbers for Visa, Mastercard, and American Express networks. The pattern
  matches 13- to 16-digit card numbers based on the leading digits assigned to each network by the ISO/IEC 7812
  standard. This is commonly used for PCI-DSS compliance scanning across EU-regulated financial data.
operation: >-
  Corroborative evidence: 6 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: financial-credit-card, financial-cvv,
  financial-expiry.
pattern: \b(?:4[0-9]{12}(?:[0-9]{3})?|5[1-5][0-9]{14}|3[47][0-9]{13})\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  Card numbers have well-defined prefix ranges (4 for Visa, 51-55 for Mastercard, 34/37 for Amex) and fixed lengths,
  giving this pattern strong structural precision. Luhn validation as a post-match step further reduces false positives.
