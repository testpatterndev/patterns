description: >-
  Detects China Physical Addresses patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in
  sensitive information type that uses machine learning and function-based detection for physical
  address identification. This keyword list provides address-related terms for supplementary matching.
operation: >-
  Function-based detection in Microsoft Purview. This pattern uses keyword matching for
  country-specific address terminology to identify physical address data.
keywords:
  - 路
  - 街
  - 道
  - 巷
  - 弄
  - 号
  - 楼
  - 室
  - 省
  - 市
  - 区
  - 县
  - 镇
  - 村
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: broad keyword matching on address terms requires additional context and
  corroborative evidence for accurate physical address detection. Address keywords alone
  produce high false positive rates without structural validation.

test_cases:
  should_match:
    - value: "123 路 name, unit 4"
      description: Contains address keyword '路'
    - value: "located at 45 街 example"
      description: Contains address keyword '街'
    - value: "deliver to 78 道 test"
      description: Contains address keyword '道'
  should_not_match:
    - value: "quarterly financial report for fiscal year 2024"
      description: Business text with no address keywords
    - value: "the meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday morning"
      description: Scheduling text with no address terminology
false_positives:
  - description: References to street names in non-address contexts such as business names or landmarks
    mitigation: >-
      Require structural address patterns (number + street type + name) rather than isolated keyword matches.
  - description: Navigation or mapping references that mention road types without containing actual addresses
    mitigation: >-
      Use proximity-based corroborative evidence to ensure keywords appear alongside numeric components.
