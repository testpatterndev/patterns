  Detects Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) file numbers used to identify
  Australian veterans and eligible dependants for health and support services.
operation: >-
  Matches a DVA file number consisting of a state letter (N, V, Q, S, W, A, T, D)
  optionally followed by a card-type letter, then 5-7 digits. Corroborative evidence:
  19 keywords within 300 characters.
pattern: "\\b[NVQSWATD][XKVGTASBM]?\\d{5,7}\\b"
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  Medium confidence: the format is relatively short and state-letter prefixes could match
  other identifiers. Corroborative keywords improve accuracy.
