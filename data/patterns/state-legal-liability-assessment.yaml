description: 'Detects internal legal assessments quantifying the State''s liability exposure on specific matters (tort, contract,
  statutory). Disclosure reveals the State''s own estimate of its likely loss, undermining defence and settlement positions
  across multiple related matters. Note: trainable classifier recommended for production using liability document structural
  features.'
operation: 'Primary detection: keyword proximity matching liability assessment terms (''liability assessment'', ''liability
  exposure'', ''legal liability'', ''risk of liability'', ''quantum assessment'', ''damages assessment'') within 200 characters
  of government/privilege terms (''State'', ''Crown'', ''Queensland'', ''government'', ''privilege'', ''PROTECTED'', ''$'').
  Trainable classifier fallback: document structure detection for liability analysis sections, quantum estimates, probability
  assessments, recommended provisions. Corroborative evidence: 3 keywords within 300 characters.'

confidence_justification: 'High confidence: Liability/quantum/damages assessment + State/government context + privilege markers
  precisely targets internal government legal exposure documents. The combination eliminates general insurance and academic
