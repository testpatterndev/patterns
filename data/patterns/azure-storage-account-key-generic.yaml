type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects generic Azure Storage account key patterns including keys assigned to variables or configuration properties.
  This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may
  prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Matches Azure Storage account keys in assignment context (key=value or key:value format) with Base64-encoded values.
  This is a broader variant that catches keys in configuration files and code. Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords
  within 300 characters. Keyword lists: credentials-api-keys.
pattern: (?i)(storage[._-]?key|account[._-]?key|storage[._-]?account[._-]?key)\s*[:=]\s*"?[A-Za-z0-9+/]{43,88}={0,2}"?
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  Medium confidence: matches storage key assignments but the Base64 pattern can overlap with other encoded data. Context
  keywords improve accuracy.

      Require proximity to Azure-specific keywords for differentiation.
