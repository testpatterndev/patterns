description: Detects Centrelink Customer Reference Number (CRN) patterns consisting of 9 digits followed by a letter.
operation: >-
  Regex pattern using universal engine. The top-level regex \b\d{9}[A-Za-z]\b matches 9 digits followed by a single
  letter. The Purview engine uses two regexes: Pattern_crn_labeled (labeled format with CRN/Centrelink prefix +
  digits + letter) and Pattern_au_crn (bare 9-digit + letter format). Three confidence tiers: High (85) requires
  Services Australia keywords + welfare context keywords with template exclusion logic; Medium (75) requires Services
  Australia keywords; Low (65) requires only the regex match. Evidence uses 2 keyword groups (4 Services Australia
  terms, 10 welfare context terms) within 300-character proximity. Keyword lists: au-identity-centrelink,
  au-government-services-australia.
pattern: \b\d{9}[A-Za-z]\b
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: the 9-digit-plus-letter pattern is generic and may match unrelated alphanumeric sequences.
  Corroborative evidence keywords such as Centrelink, CRN, or Services Australia are essential for reliable detection.

  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to centrelink customer reference number appearing in policy documents, training

    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
