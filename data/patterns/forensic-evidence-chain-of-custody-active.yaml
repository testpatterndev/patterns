description: Detects documents containing forensic evidence details, DNA or fingerprint matches, ballistics results, and chain-of-custody
  documentation for active criminal prosecutions. Premature disclosure enables defence challenges to evidence integrity that
  can collapse prosecutions for serious offences.
operation: 'Keyword proximity: primary keywords (chain of custody, exhibit register, forensic evidence, DNA profile match,
  fingerprint match, ballistics match) within 300 characters of case numbers and prosecution markers (committal, indictment,
  trial date). Regex for QPS exhibit reference number patterns. Negative keyword exclusion for concluded cases and training.'

confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: requires co-occurrence of forensic evidence chain-of-custody terminology with
  active prosecution markers and exhibit reference numbers. The proximity requirement for active prosecution terms (committal,
  indictment, trial date) distinguishes active cases from historical or concluded matters.'
