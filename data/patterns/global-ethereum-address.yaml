      Financial terminology appearing in published reports, accounting textbooks, regulatory guidance, or template
      documents without actual transaction data.

      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window. Cross-reference with structured financial
      identifiers to confirm actual sensitive data.
  - description: >-
      In English (as the primary international business language), standard business terminology overlapping with
      financial detection keywords in routine correspondence and documentation.
    mitigation: >-
      Increase confidence threshold when scanning business correspondence. Layer with transaction-specific patterns for
      higher precision.
