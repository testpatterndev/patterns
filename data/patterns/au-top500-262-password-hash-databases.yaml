name: Password hash databases
slug: au-top500-262-password-hash-databases
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies password hash databases patterns in security and access control contexts. Detects potential exposure of
  sensitive security information in Australian systems.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses word-boundary phrase matching with flexible whitespace.
  Corroborative evidence: 7 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: credentials-passwords.
pattern: \bpassword\s+hash\s+databases\b
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence marker: phrase-based artifact detection to bootstrap line-by-line coverage. Requires corroborative
  evidence and later hardening to high-confidence structural patterns.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Authentication-related terminology in software documentation, security training materials, or system architecture
      descriptions without actual credentials.
    mitigation: >-
      Require proximity to credential-specific patterns (API keys, connection strings, tokens) rather than general
      security terminology.
  - description: >-
      Code snippets and configuration examples containing credential-related keywords or placeholder values in developer
      documentation.
    mitigation: >-
      Check for common placeholder patterns (example.com, localhost, 0000) and documentation file types to reduce false
      positives from technical writing.
