operation: 'Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: credentials-connection.'
pattern: https?://[a-z0-9\-]+(\.[a-z0-9\-]+)*\.svc\.cluster\.local(:\d+)?
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: structurally constrained pattern with corroborative keyword support reduces false positive rates
  significantly.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Authentication-related terminology in software documentation, security training materials, or system architecture
      descriptions without actual credentials.
    mitigation: >-
      Require proximity to credential-specific patterns (API keys, connection strings, tokens) rather than general
      security terminology.
  - description: >-
      Code snippets and configuration examples containing credential-related keywords or placeholder values in developer
      documentation.
    mitigation: >-
      Check for common placeholder patterns (example.com, localhost, 0000) and documentation file types to reduce false
      positives from technical writing.
