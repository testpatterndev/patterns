  ''administrative review'') within 200 characters of defence/privilege indicators (''defence'', ''defence strategy'', ''respondent'',
  ''grounds'', ''privilege'', ''PROTECTED''). Combined with government entity context (Queensland Government, State of Queensland,
  Director-General). Corroborative evidence: 3 keywords within 300 characters.'
