slug: payroll-master-file-with-tax-file-numbers
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: universal
description: Detects bulk payroll data files containing employee names, Tax File Numbers (TFNs), bank account details, and
  salary information. Disclosure enables mass identity theft, fraudulent tax returns, and targeted social engineering.
operation: Regex for TFN format (8-9 digits) within 300 characters of payroll keywords (payroll, TFN, tax file, salary). Combined
  with BSB format regex or bank account terms. High confidence when multiple TFNs appear in the same document indicating a
  bulk file.
pattern: \b\d{8,9}\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: TFN-format numbers co-occurring with payroll context keywords and BSB patterns
  in a document strongly indicates a payroll master file. The requirement for multiple TFNs and payroll context eliminates
  isolated number matches.'

false_positives:
- description: HR onboarding forms requesting a single employee's TFN
  mitigation: Require multiple TFN-pattern matches (3+) in the same document to indicate bulk data rather than a single record
- description: Aggregate payroll reports with summary statistics but no individual records
  mitigation: Require co-occurrence of TFN-format numbers with payroll context rather than summary dollar amounts alone
