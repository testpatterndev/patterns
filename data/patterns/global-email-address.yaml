engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects email addresses conforming to common real-world formats. The pattern matches a local part containing
  alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, and hyphens, followed by an at sign and a
  domain with at least one dot and a two-or-more-character top-level domain. This covers the vast majority of email
  addresses encountered in documents, forms, and data exports.
operation: >-
  Reference: https://emailregex.com/ Corroborative evidence: 11 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists:
  email-labels, email-actions.
pattern: \b[A-Za-z0-9._%+\-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.\-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  The user@domain.tld structure is highly distinctive and rarely appears in non-email contexts. The requirement for an
  at sign, a dot-separated domain, and a TLD of at least two characters provides strong structural constraints that keep
  false positive rates very low.
