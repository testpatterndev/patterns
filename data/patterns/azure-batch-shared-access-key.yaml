slug: azure-batch-shared-access-key
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects Azure Batch account shared access key patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in
  sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this
  version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Matches Base64-encoded Azure Batch shared access keys, typically 88 characters long, often found in connection strings
  or configuration files. Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: credentials-api-keys.
pattern: (?i)(?:AccountKey|SharedAccessKey|batch[._-]?key)\s*=\s*[A-Za-z0-9+/]{43,88}={0,2}
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: structurally constrained Base64 key pattern with Azure Batch context keywords reduces false positive
  rates significantly.

false_positives:
  - description: Configuration templates with placeholder Base64 values for Azure Batch accounts.
    mitigation: Check for common placeholder patterns and combine with Azure Batch specific context keywords.
  - description: Other Azure service keys that use similar Base64 encoding format.
    mitigation: Use corroborative keywords specific to Azure Batch to differentiate from other Azure services.
