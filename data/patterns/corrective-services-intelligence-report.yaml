description: Detects documents containing prison intelligence reports including gang assessments, inmate risk ratings, informant
  identities within correctional facilities, and security threat group (STG) analyses. Disclosure endangers correctional staff,
  informant inmates, and undermines facility security.
operation: 'Keyword proximity: primary keywords (corrective services intelligence, prison intelligence, security threat group,
  STG assessment, inmate intelligence) within 300 characters of corroborative keywords (QCS, Queensland Corrective Services,
  facility name, risk classification terms). Document markers from QCS intelligence report templates. Negative keyword exclusion
  for public reports and media.'

confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: requires co-occurrence of correctional intelligence terminology with inmate identifiers,
  facility references, and risk classification language. The specificity of STG assessment and custodial intelligence terms,
  combined with classification markers, strongly indicates genuine intelligence reports.'
