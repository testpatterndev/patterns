type: keyword_list
description: >-
  Detects Australia Physical Addresses patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive
  information type that uses machine learning and function-based detection for physical address identification. This
  keyword list provides address-related terms for supplementary matching.
operation: >-
  Function-based detection in Microsoft Purview. This pattern uses keyword matching for country-specific address
  terminology to identify physical address data.
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: broad keyword matching on address terms requires additional context and corroborative evidence for
  accurate physical address detection. Address keywords alone produce high false positive rates without structural
  validation.

test_cases:
  should_match:
    - value: 123 street name, unit 4
      description: Contains address keyword 'street'
    - value: located at 45 road example
      description: Contains address keyword 'road'
    - value: deliver to 78 avenue test
      description: Contains address keyword 'avenue'
  should_not_match:
    - value: quarterly financial report for fiscal year 2024
      description: Business text with no address keywords
    - value: the meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday morning
      description: Scheduling text with no address terminology
false_positives:
  - description: References to street names in non-address contexts such as business names or landmarks
    mitigation: Require structural address patterns (number + street type + name) rather than isolated keyword matches.
  - description: Navigation or mapping references that mention road types without containing actual addresses
    mitigation: Use proximity-based corroborative evidence to ensure keywords appear alongside numeric components.

risk_rating: 3
risk_description: >-
  Physical addresses can identify where individuals live or work and may be partially public information. In aggregate
  or combined with other PII, addresses enable stalking, social engineering, and targeted phishing.
