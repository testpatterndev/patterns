description: Detects New Zealand Ministry of Health Number patterns. This pattern
  is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information type. Due to the
  generic numeric format, corroborative evidence keywords are essential for reliable
  detection.
operation: 'Corroborative evidence: 5 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists:
  nhi, nz-health. Uses additional domain-context evidence and explicit exclusion logic
  for template/sample/test text.'
pattern: \b[A-Z]{3}\d{4}\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: the three-letter-four-digit format is
  relatively distinctive. Combined with NHI-related keywords, this pattern reliably
  identifies New Zealand Ministry of Health numbers. Added context gating and exclusion
  rules improve precision and reduce incidental matches.'

    description: Only two letters, too short for NHI format
  - value: ABCD5678
    description: Four letters, exceeds NHI letter prefix length
  - value: template example placeholder record identifier
    description: Template/sample context should be excluded even when anchor words
      are present
false_positives:
- description: Generic numeric sequences matching the digit pattern in non-health
    contexts
  mitigation: Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window
    to distinguish health identifiers from general numeric data.
- description: Reference numbers or account identifiers from other domains with similar
    digit counts
  mitigation: Layer with document classification to prioritise matches in health and
    medical documents.
