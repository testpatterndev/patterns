description: >-
  Detects Azure subscription management certificate patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in
  sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this
  version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Matches Base64-encoded management certificates found in Azure publish settings files and subscription configuration.
  These certificates provide full access to Azure subscription management APIs. Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords
  within 300 characters. Keyword lists: credentials-api-keys.
pattern: (?i)(ManagementCertificate|management[._-]?cert)\s*=\s*"?[A-Za-z0-9+/]{100,}={0,2}"?
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: long Base64-encoded certificate value with management certificate context keywords provides strong
  structural constraint.
