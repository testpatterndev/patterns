version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects Spain driver's license number patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive
  information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as
  a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Matches 8 digits followed by 1 uppercase letter at word boundaries. Note this format is the same as the Spanish DNI.
  Corroborative evidence: 5 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: pii-civic-credentials.
pattern: \b\d{8}[A-Z]\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  Medium confidence: pattern has structural constraints but corroborative keywords are recommended to reduce false
  positive rates. Note the format overlaps with Spanish DNI numbers.

      description: Too few digits (7 instead of 8)
false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Spanish DNI (national identity document) numbers share the same format of 8 digits followed by a letter, making it
      impossible to distinguish between DNI and driver's license numbers by format alone.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords specific to driver's license context within the proximity window.
