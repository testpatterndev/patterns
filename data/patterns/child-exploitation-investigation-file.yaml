description: Detects documents containing child exploitation investigation case files including victim identification data,
  offender network intelligence, and investigative techniques used against CSAM distribution networks. QPS Task Force Argos
  is the primary Queensland unit. Disclosure re-victimises children and compromises active rescue operations.
operation: 'Keyword proximity: primary keywords (child exploitation, CSAM, child abuse material, victim identification, Task
  Force Argos, online child exploitation) within 300 characters of case reference numbers, suspect identifiers, and network
  topology data. Document markers from Argos case management templates and ACCCE coordination documents. Negative keyword
  exclusion for public awareness campaigns and media.'

confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: requires co-occurrence of child exploitation investigation terminology with case-specific
  identifiers and QPS unit references. The combination of CSAM investigation language with victim identification and offender
  network terms is highly specific to genuine case files. Generic child protection terminology alone does not trigger detection.'
