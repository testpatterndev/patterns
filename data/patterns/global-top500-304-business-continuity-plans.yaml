name: Business continuity plans
slug: global-top500-304-business-continuity-plans
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: Identifies business continuity plans patterns in security and access
  control contexts. Detects potential exposure of sensitive security information in
  international systems.
operation: 'Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors
  with proximity constraints to match domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence:
  6 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: industry-education. Uses additional
  domain-context evidence and explicit exclusion logic for template/sample/test text.'
pattern: (?is)\b(?:backup|disaster\s+recovery|business\s+continuity|failover|capacity|cmdb|endpoint\s+management|dns|maintenance|outage|dependency)\b\s{0,220}\b(?:plan|map|snapshot|catalog|analysis|profile|file)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: category-aware structural regex with anchor and context
  constraints replaces phrase-only detection. Added context gating and exclusion rules
  improve precision and reduce incidental matches.

  should_match:
  - value: Business continuity plans
    description: Exact phrase marker match
  - value: business continuity plans
    description: Case-insensitive phrase match
  - value: Business continuity plans
    description: Normalized whitespace phrase
  - value: structured artifact containing anchor terms and contextual fields
    description: Structural anchor sample
  should_not_match:
  - value: unrelated generic text
    description: No relevant phrase context
  - value: placeholder value 12345
    description: Random text should not match phrase marker
  - value: generic prose without structural artifact anchors
    description: Should not match plain mentions
  - value: template example placeholder record identifier
    description: Template/sample context should be excluded even when anchor words
      are present
false_positives:
- description: Authentication-related terminology in software documentation, security
    training materials, or system architecture descriptions without actual credentials.
  mitigation: Require proximity to credential-specific patterns (API keys, connection
    strings, tokens) rather than general security terminology.
- description: Code snippets and configuration examples containing credential-related
    keywords or placeholder values in developer documentation.
  mitigation: Check for common placeholder patterns (example.com, localhost, 0000)
    and documentation file types to reduce false positives from technical writing.
