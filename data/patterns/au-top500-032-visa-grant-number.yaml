name: Visa grant number
slug: au-top500-032-visa-grant-number
version: 1.1.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies documents containing references to visa grant number in Australian contexts. This information type is
  classified as personally identifiable information under the Privacy Act 1988.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Three-tier purview detection: high confidence (95) matches 13-digit visa
  grant number with visa-specific evidence and template exclusion; medium confidence (85) matches with immigration
  evidence; low confidence (75) matches with Home Affairs evidence. Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords within 300
  characters. Keyword lists: pii-civic-credentials.
pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(?:passport|license|certificate|visa|permit|identity|registration|file\s+number)\b\s{0,120}\b[A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9\-/
  ]{4,24}\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: category-aware structural regex with anchor and context constraints replaces phrase-only detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to visa grant number appearing in policy documents, training materials, HR
      templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
