description: Detects documents containing drug trafficking investigation intelligence including targets, supply chain mapping,
  precursor chemical tracking, clandestine laboratory intelligence, and cross-border interdiction plans. QPS Drug and Serious
  Crime Group is the primary unit. Disclosure enables traffickers to destroy evidence, alter supply routes, and eliminate
  informants.
operation: 'Keyword proximity: primary keywords (drug trafficking investigation, controlled delivery, precursor tracking,
  drug supply chain, clandestine laboratory) within 300 characters of operational terms (buy-bust, test purchase, controlled
  delivery authorisation) and QPS Drug and Serious Crime Group markers. Negative keyword exclusion for public health and media.'

confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: requires co-occurrence of drug trafficking investigation terminology with operational
  planning language and classification markers. The specificity of controlled delivery, precursor tracking, and supply chain
  intelligence terms distinguishes genuine investigation documents from public health or media references.'
