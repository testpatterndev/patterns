description: >-
  Detects AWS Secret Key patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: 'Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: credentials-api-keys, credentials-passwords.'
pattern: \b[A-Za-z0-9/+=]{40}\b
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: generic pattern format that may match unrelated data. Corroborative evidence keywords are essential
  for reliable detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Authentication-related terminology in software documentation, security training materials, or system architecture
      descriptions without actual credentials.
    mitigation: >-
      Require proximity to credential-specific patterns (API keys, connection strings, tokens) rather than general
      security terminology.
  - description: >-
      Code snippets and configuration examples containing credential-related keywords or placeholder values in developer
      documentation.
    mitigation: >-
      Check for common placeholder patterns (example.com, localhost, 0000) and documentation file types to reduce false
      positives from technical writing.

  Exposure of this credential could grant unauthorized access to cloud infrastructure, databases, or services.
