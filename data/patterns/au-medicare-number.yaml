description: >-
  Detects Australian Medicare card numbers, which are issued to Australian citizens and permanent residents for access
  to subsidised healthcare under the Medicare system. The number consists of 10 digits: the first digit is between 2 and
  6, followed by 8 additional digits and a single check digit. Numbers are commonly formatted as groups of 4-5-1 digits
  separated by spaces or hyphens.

  Validation: Mod 10 with weights [1,3,7,9,1,3,7,9]. Reference: https://clearwater.com.au/code/medicare/,
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sit-defn-australia-medical-account-number Corroborative evidence: 6 keywords
  within 300 characters. Keyword lists: au-identity-medicare, au-healthcare-identifiers, pii-government-id.
pattern: \b[2-6]\d{3}[\s-]?\d{5}[\s-]?\d{1}\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence when corroborative evidence keywords are present. The leading digit constraint (2-6) and fixed
  10-digit length reduce false positives compared to generic digit sequences. Combined with proximity keywords like
  "medicare" or "health insurance", this pattern reliably identifies Medicare numbers.

false_positives:

    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within proximity window to confirm context as a Medicare number rather
      than a phone number.
  - description: Australian Business Number (ABN) digit subsequences that overlap with the Medicare pattern
    mitigation: >-
      Use corroborative evidence to distinguish Medicare context from business-related contexts. Layer with ABN-specific
      detection to deprioritise overlapping matches.
