  type is classified as personally identifiable information under the Privacy Act 1988.

pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(?:refugee\s+or\s+asylum\s+case\s+number|id|identifier|number|no\.?|reference|record)\b\s{0,80}\b[A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9\-/
  ]{4,24}\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: identifier/document-structure anchored regex with constrained context replaces phrase-only detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to refugee or asylum case number appearing in policy documents, training

    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
