slug: us-drivers-license
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects U.S. driver's license number patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive
  information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as
  a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Matches U.S. driver's license formats which vary by state: letter followed by 7-12 digits, or 7-9 digits alone.
  Corroborative evidence: 5 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: pii-government-id.
pattern: \b[A-Z]\d{7,12}\b|\b\d{7,9}\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  Medium confidence: pattern has structural constraints but the wide variation across US states means corroborative
  keywords are strongly recommended to reduce false positive rates.

      description: Two leading letters instead of one
false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Generic numeric sequences matching the driver's license format appearing in unrelated contexts. The broad format
      variation across US states increases the false positive rate.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm driver's license context.
