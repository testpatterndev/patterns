description: Detects documents authorising settlement ranges, negotiation floors/ceilings, and approved concession parameters.
  Disclosure reveals the State's maximum position, destroying negotiation leverage and potentially costing tens of millions
  in lost bargaining position.
operation: 'Primary detection: keyword proximity matching settlement/negotiation authority terms within 200 characters of
  approval indicators (''approved'', ''authorised'') or currency amounts. Regex detection: dollar amounts ($X,XXX,XXX or $X.XM
  format) near settlement/authority keywords. Corroborative evidence: 3 keywords within 300 characters.'

confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: Settlement authority terminology is highly specific to legal practice authorisation
  workflows. Combined with dollar amounts and approval language, detection precisely targets actual authorisation documents
  rather than general discussion.'
