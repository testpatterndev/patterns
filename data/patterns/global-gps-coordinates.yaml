description: Detects GPS Coordinates (Decimal Degrees) patterns. Requires location/GPS context keywords
operation: 'Corroborative evidence: 3 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: emerging-geolocation.'
pattern: \b-?\d{1,3}\.\d{4,}\s*,\s*-?\d{1,3}\.\d{4,}\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  Medium confidence: pattern has structural constraints but corroborative keywords are recommended to reduce false
  positive rates.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to gps coordinates (decimal degrees) appearing in policy documents, training
      materials, HR templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In English (as the primary international business language), similar terminology used in formal or administrative
      contexts (education, professional documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
