version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies documents containing references to letters of intent in Australian contexts. This information type is
  classified as personally identifiable information under applicable data protection regulations.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors with proximity constraints to match
  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 6 keywords within 300 characters.
pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(?:m&a|merger|acquisition|valuation|synergy|integration|divestiture|strategy|roadmap|investor|fundraising|scenario)\b\s{0,220}\b(?:plan|model|file|analysis|presentation|draft|sheet)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: category-aware structural regex with anchor and context constraints replaces phrase-only detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to letters of intent appearing in policy documents, training materials, HR
      templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
