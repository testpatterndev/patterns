description: Detects documents containing telecommunications interception warrants and stored communications warrants issued
  under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth). Disclosure of the existence of an interception warrant
  is a criminal offence under s.63 of the TIA Act and alerts targets to switch to unmonitored channels.
operation: 'Regex for TIA Act warrant reference numbers combined with keyword proximity: primary keywords (telecommunications
  interception, TI warrant, TIA Act, interception warrant, stored communications warrant, B-party warrant) within 300 characters
  of target identifiers (phone numbers, IMEI, email). Document markers referencing s.6 secrecy provisions.'

confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: the combination of TIA Act-specific terminology with warrant reference numbers
  and target identifiers is highly distinctive. These terms rarely appear together outside genuine interception warrant documents.
