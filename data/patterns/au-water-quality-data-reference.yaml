description: Detects references to water quality monitoring data, compliance reports, and environmental water testing results.
operation: >-
  Keyword-only pattern using Purview regex engine. The Purview regex Pattern_water_quality_phrase matches phrases such
  as water quality, water testing, water sample, water treatment, water monitoring, water compliance, ADWG, Australian
  Drinking Water Guidelines, turbidity, E. coli/coliform test/level/result/count, effluent quality, and catchment data.
  Three confidence tiers: High (85) requires infrastructure context + environmental monitoring keywords with template
  exclusion logic; Medium (75) requires infrastructure context keywords; Low (65) requires only the regex match.
  Evidence uses 2 keyword groups (8 infrastructure context terms, 10 environmental monitoring terms) within
  300-character proximity. Template/sample exclusion prevents false positives from training materials.
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  Medium confidence: keyword-based detection relies on phrase-matching regex within the Purview engine. Corroborative
  evidence keywords are needed for reliable identification since water-related terms can appear in non-monitoring
  contexts.
