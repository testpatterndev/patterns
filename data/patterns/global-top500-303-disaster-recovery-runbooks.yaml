name: Disaster recovery runbooks
slug: global-top500-303-disaster-recovery-runbooks
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: Identifies disaster recovery runbooks patterns in security and access
  control contexts. Detects potential exposure of sensitive security information in
  international systems.
operation: 'Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses word-boundary phrase
  matching with flexible whitespace. Corroborative evidence: 6 keywords within 300
  characters. Uses additional domain-context evidence and explicit exclusion logic
  for template/sample/test text.'
pattern: (?is)\b(?:disaster\s+recovery|dr\s+runbook|rto|rpo|recovery\s+time\s+objective)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: structural regex with domain-specific anchors and constrained
  context replaces phrase-only marker. Added context gating and exclusion rules improve
  precision and reduce incidental matches.

    description: Normalized whitespace phrase
  - value: structured sample with matching anchors
    description: Structural anchor sample
  should_not_match:
  - value: unrelated generic text
    description: No relevant phrase context
  - value: placeholder value 12345
    description: Random text should not match phrase marker
  - value: generic policy prose without anchors
    description: Should reject generic mentions without structural anchor terms
  - value: template example placeholder record identifier
    description: Template/sample context should be excluded even when anchor words
      are present
false_positives:
- description: Authentication-related terminology in software documentation, security
    training materials, or system architecture descriptions without actual credentials.
  mitigation: Require proximity to credential-specific patterns (API keys, connection
    strings, tokens) rather than general security terminology.
- description: Code snippets and configuration examples containing credential-related
    keywords or placeholder values in developer documentation.
  mitigation: Check for common placeholder patterns (example.com, localhost, 0000)
    and documentation file types to reduce false positives from technical writing.
