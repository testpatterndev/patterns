  \b(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d\d?)\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d\d?)\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d\d?)\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d\d?)\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: structurally constrained pattern with corroborative keyword support reduces false positive rates
  significantly.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to ipv4 appearing in policy documents, training materials, HR templates, or
      compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In English (as the primary international business language), similar terminology used in formal or administrative
      contexts (education, professional documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
