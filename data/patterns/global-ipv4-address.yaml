description: >-
  Detects IPv4 patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Reference: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc791 Corroborative evidence: 5 keywords within 300 characters.
  Keyword lists: pii-contact.
pattern: >-
  \b(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d\d?)\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d\d?)\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d\d?)\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d\d?)\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: structurally constrained pattern with corroborative keyword support reduces false positive rates
  significantly.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to ipv4 appearing in policy documents, training materials, HR templates, or
      compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In English (as the primary international business language), similar terminology used in formal or administrative
      contexts (education, professional documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.

risk_description: >-
  IP addresses reveal network location and can be used to identify individuals or target infrastructure. While not
  directly PII in isolation, they can be correlated with other data for tracking or launching targeted attacks.
