description: >-
  Detects US passport numbers, which consist of 8 to 9 digits optionally preceded by a single uppercase letter. Older US
  passports use a 9-digit numeric format, while newer passport books and cards may include a single alpha prefix
  followed by 8 digits. Due to the relatively simple format, corroborative keyword proximity is strongly recommended to
  reduce false positives.

confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  The US passport number format is short and loosely structured, consisting of an optional letter followed by 8-9
  digits. This simplicity means the pattern can match many unrelated numeric strings such as reference codes, invoice
  numbers, and account identifiers. Medium confidence is appropriate; strong corroborative keyword proximity is
  essential for reliable detection.

      Require strong corroborative keyword proximity (e.g., 'passport', 'travel document') within 300 characters to
      confirm the match as a genuine passport number
  - description: Reference codes and serial numbers with an optional single-letter prefix
    mitigation: >-
      Cross-reference with document context and additional entity detection to distinguish passport numbers from generic
      alphanumeric identifiers
