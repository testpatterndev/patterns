  Detects All Full Names patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in
  sensitive information type that uses machine learning and function-based detection for
  personal name identification. This keyword list provides name-related terms for supplementary matching.
operation: >-
  Function-based detection in Microsoft Purview. This pattern uses keyword matching for
  name-related terminology to identify personal names in documents.
keywords:
  - first name
  - last name
  - full name
  - given name
  - surname
  - family name
  - middle name
  - maiden name
  - name
  - forename
  - patronymic
  - matronymic
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: broad keyword matching on name-related terms requires additional context.
  Name keywords appear frequently in forms, directories, and general documents without
  constituting sensitive personal information.

    mitigation: >-
      Use document classification to distinguish personnel records from technical documentation.
