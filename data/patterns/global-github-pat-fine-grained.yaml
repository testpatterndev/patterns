  Detects GitHub Fine-Grained PAT patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information
  type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a starting
  point for customisation.

  Reference: https://github.blog/2022-10-18-introducing-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens-for-github/ Corroborative
  evidence: 8 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: credentials-api-keys, credentials-tokens.
pattern: \bgithub_pat_[A-Za-z0-9]{22}_[A-Za-z0-9]{59}\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: structurally constrained pattern with corroborative keyword support reduces false positive rates
  significantly.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Authentication-related terminology in software documentation, security training materials, or system architecture
      descriptions without actual credentials.
    mitigation: >-
      Require proximity to credential-specific patterns (API keys, connection strings, tokens) rather than general
      security terminology.
  - description: >-
      Code snippets and configuration examples containing credential-related keywords or placeholder values in developer
      documentation.
    mitigation: >-
      Check for common placeholder patterns (example.com, localhost, 0000) and documentation file types to reduce false
      positives from technical writing.
