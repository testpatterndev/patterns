description: Detects Singapore driving license number patterns. This pattern is based
  on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information type. Users already running
  Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a
  starting point for customisation.
operation: 'Matches the letter S followed by 7 digits and 1 uppercase letter at word
  boundaries. Corroborative evidence: 5 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists:
  pii-civic-credentials. Uses additional domain-context evidence and explicit exclusion
  logic for template/sample/test text.'
pattern: \bS\d{7}[A-Z]\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: 'Medium confidence: pattern has structural constraints but
  corroborative keywords are recommended to reduce false positive rates. Added context
  gating and exclusion rules improve precision and reduce incidental matches.'

  should_not_match:
  - value: T1234567A
    description: Wrong leading letter (T instead of S)
  - value: S123456A
    description: Too few digits (6 instead of 7)
  - value: template example placeholder record identifier
    description: Template/sample context should be excluded even when anchor words
      are present
false_positives:
- description: Generic alphanumeric sequences matching the driving license format
    appearing in unrelated contexts, particularly Singapore NRIC numbers which share
    a similar format.
  mitigation: Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window
    to confirm driving license context.
