description: >-
  Detects US Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) issued by the IRS to individuals who are required to
  have a US taxpayer identification number but are not eligible for a Social Security Number. ITINs always begin with
  the digit 9, and the fourth and fifth digits fall in the range 70-99, distinguishing them from SSNs. The pattern
  matches both formatted (9XX-7X-XXXX) and unformatted (9XX7XXXXX) variants.

  The ITIN format is well-defined by the IRS with a unique structure starting with 9 and having fourth-fifth digits in
  the 70-99 range. This specificity, combined with corroborative keyword proximity, provides high-confidence
  identification with low false positive rates.
