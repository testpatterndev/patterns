type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in
  sensitive information type. Due to the generic numeric format, corroborative evidence keywords
  are essential for reliable detection.
operation: >-
  Corroborative evidence: 5 keywords within 300 characters.
  Keyword lists: icd-9, diagnosis-codes.
pattern: '\b\d{3}\.?\d{0,2}\b'
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: three-digit numbers with optional decimal are extremely common in non-medical contexts. Corroborative evidence such as 'ICD-9' or 'diagnosis code' is essential for accurate detection.

      health identifiers from general numeric data.
  - description: Reference numbers or account identifiers from other domains with similar digit counts
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with document classification to prioritise matches in health and medical documents.
