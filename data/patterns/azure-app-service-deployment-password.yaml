type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects Azure App Service deployment passwords in configuration files and publish profiles. This pattern is based on a
  Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in
  SIT directly, or use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Matches deployment credentials in Azure publish settings XML files, including userPWD and password attributes with
  Base64 or alphanumeric values. Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists:
  credentials-api-keys.
pattern: (?i)(userPWD|publishPassword|password)\s*=\s*"?[A-Za-z0-9+/=]{20,}"?
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: structurally constrained pattern matching deployment credential assignments with corroborative keyword
  support reduces false positive rates significantly.

      Non-Azure password attributes in configuration files that happen to match the pattern.
    mitigation: >-
      Require proximity to Azure App Service specific keywords to reduce cross-platform false positives.
