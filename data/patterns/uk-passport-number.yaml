      In British English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.

      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.

      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
