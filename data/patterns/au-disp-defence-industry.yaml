  Detects references to Defence Industry Security Program (DISP) membership and defence industry security markers in
  Australian documents.
operation: >-
  Keyword-only pattern using Purview regex engine. The Purview regex Pattern_disp_phrase matches phrases such as DISP
  membership, DISP accreditation, Defence Industry Security Program, defence contractor, ITAR controlled, controlled
  technology, and AGSVA clearance. Three confidence tiers: High (85) requires defence context + security program
  keywords with template exclusion logic; Medium (75) requires defence context keywords; Low (65) requires only the
  regex match. Evidence uses 2 keyword groups (7 defence context terms, 9 security program terms) within 300-character
  proximity. Template/sample exclusion prevents false positives from training materials.
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  Medium confidence: keyword-based detection relies on phrase-matching regex within the Purview engine. Corroborative
  evidence keywords are needed for reliable identification since defence-related terms can appear in non-DISP contexts.
