name: Cod Numeric Personal
slug: ro-personal-numerical-code
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: universal
description: >-
  Detects Cod Numeric Personal patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sit-defn-romania-personal-numeric-code Corroborative evidence: 3 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: pii-civic-credentials.
pattern: \b[1-8]\d{12}\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: pattern has strong structural constraints (specific format, prefix, or character class restrictions) that significantly reduce false positive rates.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      The first-digit constraint (1-8) and 13-digit length provide good structural validation, but long numeric strings may appear in other contexts.
    mitigation: >-
      Validate embedded date (digits 2-7) and require corroborative evidence keywords for higher confidence.
  - description: >-
      In multiple languages, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
