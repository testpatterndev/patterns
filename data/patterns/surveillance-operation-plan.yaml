description: Detects documents containing physical and electronic surveillance operation plans including observation post
  positions, equipment deployments, team compositions, and target movement tracking plans. Disclosure enables counter-surveillance
  by criminal targets and compromises reusable surveillance positions and techniques.
operation: 'Keyword proximity: primary keywords (surveillance operation, observation post, OP plan, technical surveillance,
  listening device, tracking device, surveillance deployment) within 300 characters of location details, team callsigns, and
  equipment references. Document markers from QPS Surveillance Group templates. Negative keyword exclusion for public policy
  and academic contexts.'

confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: surveillance operation planning terminology is highly specialised and the co-occurrence
  of OP planning, equipment deployment, and target movement terms within classification markers is distinctive to genuine
  operational planning documents. General references to ''surveillance'' alone are insufficient.'
