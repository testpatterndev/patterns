name: Census microdata
slug: au-top500-500-census-microdata
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies documents containing references to census microdata in Australian contexts. This information type is
  classified as personally identifiable information under the Privacy Act 1988.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors with proximity constraints to match
  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 6 keywords within 300 characters.
pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(?:immigration|asylum|refugee|diplomatic|election|census|ballot|consular)\b\s{0,240}\b(?:case|narrative|record|extract|file|microdata|incident|assessment)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: identifier/document-structure anchored regex with constrained context replaces phrase-only detection.

    - value: Census microdata
      description: Exact phrase marker match
    - value: census microdata
      description: Case-insensitive phrase match
    - value: Census microdata
      description: Normalized whitespace phrase
    - value: structured record with identifier and contextual anchors
      description: Structural anchor sample
  should_not_match:
    - value: unrelated generic text
      description: No relevant phrase context
    - value: placeholder value 12345
      description: Random text should not match phrase marker
    - value: generic narrative without identifier/document anchors
      description: Should not match plain mention
false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to census microdata appearing in policy documents, training materials, HR
      templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
