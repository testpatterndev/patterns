name: Employee tax forms
slug: global-top500-084-employee-tax-forms
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: Detects references to employee tax forms in financial and compliance
  documents. Commonly found in international regulatory filings, transaction records,
  and audit documentation.
operation: 'Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors
  with proximity constraints to match domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence:
  6 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: industry-hr, hr-employment-records.
  Uses additional domain-context evidence and explicit exclusion logic for template/sample/test
  text.'
pattern: (?is)\b(?:payroll|withholding|deduction|tax|benefit|superannuation|garnishment|journal|arrears|reimbursement)\b\s{0,240}\b(?:employee|period|amount|withheld|account|claim|approval|exception)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: identifier/document-structure anchored regex with constrained
  context replaces phrase-only detection. Added context gating and exclusion rules
  improve precision and reduce incidental matches.

    description: Exact phrase marker match
  - value: employee tax forms
    description: Case-insensitive phrase match
  - value: Employee tax forms
    description: Normalized whitespace phrase

  should_not_match:
  - value: unrelated generic text
    description: No relevant phrase context
  - value: placeholder value 12345
    description: Random text should not match phrase marker
  - value: generic narrative without identifier/document anchors
    description: Should not match plain mention
  - value: template example placeholder record identifier
    description: Template/sample context should be excluded even when anchor words
      are present
false_positives:
- description: Financial terminology appearing in published reports, accounting textbooks,
    regulatory guidance, or template documents without actual transaction data.
  mitigation: Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window.
    Cross-reference with structured financial identifiers to confirm actual sensitive
    data.
- description: In English (as the primary international business language), standard
    business terminology overlapping with financial detection keywords in routine
    correspondence and documentation.
  mitigation: Increase confidence threshold when scanning business correspondence.
    Layer with transaction-specific patterns for higher precision.
