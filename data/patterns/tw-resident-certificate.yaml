description: >-
  Detects 外僑居留證 / 台灣地區居留證 patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sit-defn-taiwan-resident-certificate-arc-tarc-number Corroborative evidence: 4 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: pii-government-id.
pattern: \b[A-Z][A-D]\d{8}\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: pattern has strong structural constraints (specific format, prefix, or character class restrictions) that significantly reduce false positive rates.

    - value: "A123456789"
      description: Digit in second position instead of A-D
false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Two letters followed by eight digits may match some reference codes, but the A-D constraint on the second letter reduces false positives.
    mitigation: >-
      The structured format with limited second-letter range provides good validation. Keyword context further improves accuracy.
  - description: >-
      In multiple languages, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
