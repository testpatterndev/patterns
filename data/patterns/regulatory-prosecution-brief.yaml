description: Detects prosecution briefs prepared by Queensland regulatory bodies (Workplace Health and Safety, Environmental
  Protection Authority, Office of Fair Trading) for enforcement action. Disclosure compromises prosecution integrity and alerts
  enforcement targets.
operation: 'Primary detection: keyword proximity matching prosecution terms (''prosecution brief'', ''brief of evidence'',
  ''enforcement brief'', ''prosecution recommendation'') within 200 characters of regulatory body names or indicators (''WHS'',
  ''Work Health and Safety'', ''Environmental Protection'', ''Fair Trading'', ''regulatory'', ''PROTECTED''). Regex detection:
  prosecution reference numbers. Corroborative evidence: 3 keywords within 300 characters.'

confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: Prosecution brief terminology combined with specific Queensland regulatory body
  names creates a narrow detection window. The combination of legal prosecution language with regulatory context eliminates
  academic and general legal references.'
