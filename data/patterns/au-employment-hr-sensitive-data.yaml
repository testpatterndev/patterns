  Detects references to sensitive employment and human resources data including performance reviews, disciplinary
  actions, and workplace investigations.
operation: >-
  Keyword-only pattern using Purview regex engine. The Purview regex Pattern_hr_sensitive_phrase matches phrases such as
  disciplinary action, performance review, workplace investigation, workplace bullying, workplace misconduct,
  termination letter, unfair dismissal, workers compensation, grievance process, harassment complaint, return to work
  plan, and redundancy notice. Three confidence tiers: High (85) requires HR context + employment operations keywords
  with template exclusion logic; Medium (75) requires HR context keywords; Low (65) requires only the regex match.
  Evidence uses 2 keyword groups (8 HR context terms, 10 employment operations terms) within 300-character proximity.
  Template/sample exclusion prevents false positives from training materials.
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  Medium confidence: keyword-based detection relies on phrase-matching regex within the Purview engine. Corroborative
  evidence keywords are needed for reliable identification since HR-related terms can appear in non-sensitive contexts.
