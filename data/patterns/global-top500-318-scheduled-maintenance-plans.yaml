name: Scheduled maintenance plans
slug: global-top500-318-scheduled-maintenance-plans
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies scheduled maintenance plans patterns in security and access control contexts. Detects potential exposure of
  sensitive security information in international systems.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors with proximity constraints to match
  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 6 keywords within 300 characters.
pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(backup|disaster\s+recovery|business\s+continuity|failover|capacity|cmdb|endpoint\s+management|dns|maintenance|outage|dependency)\b.{0,220}\b(plan|map|snapshot|catalog|analysis|profile|file)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: category-aware structural regex with anchor and context constraints replaces phrase-only detection.

test_cases:
  should_match:
    - value: Scheduled maintenance plans
      description: Exact phrase marker match
    - value: scheduled maintenance plans
      description: Case-insensitive phrase match
    - value: Scheduled maintenance plans
      description: Normalized whitespace phrase
    - value: structured artifact containing anchor terms and contextual fields
      description: Structural anchor sample
  should_not_match:
    - value: unrelated generic text
      description: No relevant phrase context
    - value: placeholder value 12345
      description: Random text should not match phrase marker
    - value: generic prose without structural artifact anchors
      description: Should not match plain mentions
false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Authentication-related terminology in software documentation, security training materials, or system architecture
      descriptions without actual credentials.
    mitigation: >-
      Require proximity to credential-specific patterns (API keys, connection strings, tokens) rather than general
      security terminology.
  - description: >-
      Code snippets and configuration examples containing credential-related keywords or placeholder values in developer
      documentation.
    mitigation: >-
      Check for common placeholder patterns (example.com, localhost, 0000) and documentation file types to reduce false
      positives from technical writing.
