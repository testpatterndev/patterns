operation: >-
  Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sit-defn-estonia-personal-identification-code Corroborative evidence: 3 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: pii-government-id.
pattern: \b[1-6]\d{2}[01]\d[0-3]\d\d{4}\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: pattern has strong structural constraints (specific format, prefix, or character class restrictions) that significantly reduce false positive rates.

  - description: >-
      In multiple languages, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
