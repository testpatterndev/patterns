description: >-
  Detects Korea Physical Addresses patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in
  sensitive information type that uses machine learning and function-based detection for physical
  address identification. This keyword list provides address-related terms for supplementary matching.
operation: >-
  Function-based detection in Microsoft Purview. This pattern uses keyword matching for
  country-specific address terminology to identify physical address data.
keywords:
  - 시
  - 도
  - 구
  - 군
  - 읍
  - 면
  - 동
  - 리
  - 로
  - 길
  - 번지
  - 호
  - 아파트
  - 층
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: broad keyword matching on address terms requires additional context and
  corroborative evidence for accurate physical address detection. Address keywords alone
  produce high false positive rates without structural validation.

test_cases:
  should_match:
    - value: "123 시 name, unit 4"
      description: Contains address keyword '시'

      description: Scheduling text with no address terminology
false_positives:
  - description: References to street names in non-address contexts such as business names or landmarks
    mitigation: >-
      Require structural address patterns (number + street type + name) rather than isolated keyword matches.
  - description: Navigation or mapping references that mention road types without containing actual addresses
    mitigation: >-
      Use proximity-based corroborative evidence to ensure keywords appear alongside numeric components.
