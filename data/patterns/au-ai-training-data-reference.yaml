description: Detects references to AI training data, model datasets, and data provenance documentation in Australian contexts.
operation: >-
  Keyword-only pattern using Purview regex engine. The Purview regex Pattern_ai_training_phrase matches phrases such as
  training dataset, training corpus, data provenance, ML dataset, labelled data, annotated data, synthetic data, and
  model training. Three confidence tiers: High (85) requires AI context + data operations keywords with template
  exclusion logic; Medium (75) requires AI context keywords; Low (65) requires only the regex match. Evidence uses 2
  keyword groups (9 AI context terms, 9 data operations terms) within 300-character proximity. Template/sample
  exclusion prevents false positives from training materials.
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  Medium confidence: keyword-based detection relies on phrase-matching regex within the Purview engine. Corroborative
  evidence keywords are needed for reliable identification since AI-related terms can appear in non-sensitive contexts.

      description: Matches 'training dataset' via Pattern_ai_training_phrase
    - value: Review the training corpus for bias before model training
      description: Matches 'training corpus' and 'model training' via Pattern_ai_training_phrase
    - value: Data provenance report for ML dataset version 3.2
      description: Matches 'data provenance' and 'ML dataset' via Pattern_ai_training_phrase
  should_not_match:
    - value: The training schedule for new employees
      description: No AI training phrase matched by the Purview regex
    - value: AI-powered search engine results
      description: No training data phrase present
false_positives:
  - description: Generic use of training or dataset in non-AI contexts such as staff training.
    mitigation: Require multiple AI-specific keywords to co-occur within proximity.
