description: >-
  Detects Azure Storage Key patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: 'Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: credentials-api-keys.'
pattern: \b[A-Za-z0-9/+=]{88}\b
confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: generic pattern format that may match unrelated data. Corroborative evidence keywords are essential
  for reliable detection.

false_positives:

      Authentication-related terminology in software documentation, security training materials, or system architecture
      descriptions without actual credentials.
    mitigation: >-
      Require proximity to credential-specific patterns (API keys, connection strings, tokens) rather than general
      security terminology.
  - description: >-
      Code snippets and configuration examples containing credential-related keywords or placeholder values in developer
      documentation.
    mitigation: >-
      Check for common placeholder patterns (example.com, localhost, 0000) and documentation file types to reduce false
      positives from technical writing.
