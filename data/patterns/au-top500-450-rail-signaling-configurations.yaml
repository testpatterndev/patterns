name: Rail signaling configurations
slug: au-top500-450-rail-signaling-configurations
version: 1.1.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies documents containing references to rail signaling configurations in Australian contexts. This information
  type is classified as personally identifiable information under applicable data protection regulations.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Three-tier purview detection: high confidence (85) matches rail
  signaling/interlocking structural pattern with signaling evidence and template exclusion; medium confidence (75)
  matches with signaling evidence; low confidence (65) matches structural pattern alone. Corroborative evidence: 7
  keywords within 300 characters.
pattern: (?is)\b(?:rail\s+signal|interlocking|signaling)\b\s{0,220}\b(?:configuration|route|block)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: structural regex with domain-specific anchors and constrained context replaces phrase-only marker.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to rail signaling configurations appearing in policy documents, training
      materials, HR templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
