description: >-
  Detects Azure Cognitive Services subscription key patterns. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in
  sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or use this
  version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Matches Azure Cognitive Services API keys, which are 32-character hexadecimal strings used for authentication to
  services like Computer Vision, Text Analytics, and Speech. Corroborative evidence: 8 keywords within 300 characters.
  Keyword lists: credentials-api-keys.
pattern: (?i)(Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key|cognitive[._-]?key|subscription[._-]?key)\s*[:=]\s*"?[0-9A-Fa-f]{32}"?
confidence: high
confidence_justification: >-
  High confidence: structurally constrained 32-character hexadecimal pattern with Cognitive Services context keywords
  reduces false positive rates significantly.
