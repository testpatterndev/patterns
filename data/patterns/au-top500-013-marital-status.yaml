  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 6 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: pii-demographics.
pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(name|birth|nationality|citizenship|signature|gender|ethnicity|disability|genetic|biometric)\b.{0,180}\b(record|profile|status|identifier|details)\b
confidence: medium

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to marital status appearing in policy documents, training materials, HR
      templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In Australian English, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
