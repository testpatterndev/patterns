name: Pre-release test result datasets
slug: global-top500-224-pre-release-test-result-datasets
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies documents containing references to pre-release test result datasets in international contexts. This
  information type is classified as personally identifiable information under applicable data protection regulations.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors with proximity constraints to match
  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 9 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists:
  au-healthcare-records.
pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(product|quality|safety|nonconformance|recall|hazard|verification|validation|failure|warranty|root\s+cause)\b.{0,220}\b(report|plan|evidence|decision|analytics|notes)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: category-aware structural regex with anchor and context constraints replaces phrase-only detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Common words and phrases related to pre-release test result datasets appearing in policy documents, training
      materials, HR templates, or compliance guidelines without actual personal data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window to confirm sensitive data context rather than
      general discussion.
  - description: >-
      In English (as the primary international business language), similar terminology used in formal or administrative
      contexts (education, professional documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
  - description: >-
      High-frequency pattern matches in large document corpora due to broad regex anchors. Expected match rate is
      significantly higher than specific identifier patterns.
    mitigation: >-
      Tune confidence thresholds for bulk scanning. Consider using this pattern primarily as a pre-filter with secondary
      validation.
