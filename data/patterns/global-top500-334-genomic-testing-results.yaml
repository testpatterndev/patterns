version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies genomic testing results references in healthcare and patient records. Protected health information under
  applicable data protection regulations.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors with proximity constraints to match
  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 7 keywords within 300 characters.
pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(patient|clinical|diagnostic|laboratory|medication|treatment|pathology|imaging|consent|adverse\s+event|biometric|genomic|hiv)\b.{0,240}\b(record|result|history|plan|report|note|status|encounter)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: identifier/document-structure anchored regex with constrained context replaces phrase-only detection.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Medical terminology in health education materials, research publications, clinical guidelines, or public health
      documents without patient-specific data.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords confirming patient context. Look for co-occurrence with patient
      identifiers such as medical record numbers or dates of birth.
  - description: General wellness and fitness content using medical vocabulary without constituting protected health information.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with patient identifier patterns or healthcare-specific document structure detection to distinguish clinical
      records from general health content.
