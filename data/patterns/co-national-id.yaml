  Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sit-defn-colombia-national-id-card-number Corroborative evidence: 3 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists: pii-government-id.

confidence: low
confidence_justification: >-
  Low confidence: pattern is broad and will match many non-identity sequences. Corroborative keywords are essential to achieve acceptable false positive rates.

false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Variable-length numeric sequences (6-10 digits) are extremely common and will match many non-identity numbers.
    mitigation: >-
      Require corroborative evidence keywords such as "cédula" or "ciudadanía" within the proximity window. This pattern has a high false positive rate without keyword context.
  - description: >-
      In multiple languages, similar terminology used in formal or administrative contexts (education, professional
      documentation) that does not constitute sensitive data collection.
    mitigation: >-
      Layer with additional contextual signals such as structured identifiers, form fields, or database column headers
      to distinguish sensitive records from general references.
