  Detects EU driver's license number patterns across all EU member states. This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview
  built-in sensitive information type. Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or
  use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: >-
  Broad keyword-based detection for EU driver's license references. Matches alphanumeric sequences of 5-20 characters at
  word boundaries combined with driver's license keywords. Corroborative evidence: 5 keywords within 300 characters.
  Keyword lists: pii-government-id.
pattern: \b[A-Z0-9]{5,20}\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  Medium confidence: broad pattern covering multiple EU member state formats. Corroborative keywords are essential for
