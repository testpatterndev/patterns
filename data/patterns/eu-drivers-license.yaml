description: Detects EU driver's license number patterns across all EU member states.
  This pattern is based on a Microsoft Purview built-in sensitive information type.
  Users already running Purview may prefer to enable the built-in SIT directly, or
  use this version as a starting point for customisation.
operation: 'Broad keyword-based detection for EU driver''s license references. Matches
  alphanumeric sequences of 5-20 characters at word boundaries combined with driver''s
  license keywords. Corroborative evidence: 5 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword
  lists: pii-civic-credentials. Uses additional domain-context evidence and explicit
  exclusion logic for template/sample/test text.'
pattern: \b[A-Z0-9]{5,20}\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: 'Medium confidence: broad pattern covering multiple EU member
  state formats. Corroborative keywords are essential for reliable detection due to
  the wide range of formats matched. Added context gating and exclusion rules improve
  precision and reduce incidental matches.'

    description: Too many characters (21 instead of maximum 20)
  - value: template example placeholder record identifier
    description: Template/sample context should be excluded even when anchor words
      are present
false_positives:
- description: Generic alphanumeric sequences matching the broad EU driver's license
    format appearing in unrelated contexts such as product codes, serial numbers,
    or reference identifiers.
  mitigation: Require corroborative evidence keywords within the proximity window
    to confirm driver's license context.
