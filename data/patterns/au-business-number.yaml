description: >-
  Detects Australian Business Numbers (ABNs), which are unique 11-digit identifiers issued by the Australian Business
  Register to entities carrying on a business in Australia. ABNs are commonly formatted as groups of 2-3-3-3 digits
  separated by spaces or hyphens. The ABN includes a check digit mechanism, but this pattern relies on format matching
  combined with corroborative evidence rather than algorithmic validation.

  Validation: Mod 89 with weights [10,1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19], subtract 1 from first digit. Reference:

pattern: \b\d{2}[\s-]?\d{3}[\s-]?\d{3}[\s-]?\d{3}\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: >-
  Medium confidence because the 11-digit format is relatively common in financial and administrative contexts. While the
  2-3-3-3 grouping is distinctive, the pattern can match other 11-digit sequences without algorithmic check digit
  validation. Corroborative evidence keywords such as "ABN" or "Australian business number" significantly increase
  detection accuracy.

      number' nearby, suppress the match or lower the confidence score.
