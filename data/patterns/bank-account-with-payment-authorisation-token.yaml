description: Detects government bank account details (BSB + account number) combined with payment authorisation credentials,
  approval tokens, or signing authorities that together enable the initiation of payments.
operation: Regex for BSB format within 300 characters of account number pattern and authorisation/approval context keywords.
  High confidence when PROTECTED header present. Distinguished from routine BSB+account (SENS_Fin) by requiring authorisation/signing
  context.
pattern: \b\d{3}-?\d{3}\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: BSB + account number + payment authorisation credentials is a highly specific
  combination. The requirement for authorisation context (not just banking details) distinguishes this from routine SENS_Fin
  BSB detection.'
