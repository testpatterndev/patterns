slug: global-top500-253-red-team-findings
version: 1.0.0
type: regex
engine: boost_regex
description: >-
  Identifies red team findings patterns in security and access control contexts. Detects potential exposure of sensitive
  security information in international systems.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors with proximity constraints to match
  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 7 keywords within 300 characters.
pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(source\s+code|repository|api|pipeline|manifest|dependency|static\s+analysis|dynamic\s+testing|runbook|config|feature\s+flag|telemetry)\b.{0,220}\b(file|report|document|schema|map|output)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: category-aware structural regex with anchor and context constraints replaces phrase-only detection.

    - value: red team findings
      description: Case-insensitive phrase match
    - value: Red team findings

    - value: unrelated generic text
      description: No relevant phrase context
    - value: placeholder value 12345
      description: Random text should not match phrase marker
    - value: generic prose without structural artifact anchors
      description: Should not match plain mentions
false_positives:
  - description: >-
      Authentication-related terminology in software documentation, security training materials, or system architecture
      descriptions without actual credentials.
    mitigation: >-
      Require proximity to credential-specific patterns (API keys, connection strings, tokens) rather than general
      security terminology.
  - description: >-
      Code snippets and configuration examples containing credential-related keywords or placeholder values in developer
      documentation.
    mitigation: >-
      Check for common placeholder patterns (example.com, localhost, 0000) and documentation file types to reduce false
      positives from technical writing.
