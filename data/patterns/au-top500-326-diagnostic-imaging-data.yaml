description: >-
  Identifies diagnostic imaging data references in healthcare and patient records. Protected health information under
  applicable data protection regulations.
operation: >-
  Pattern type: regex (boost_regex engine). Regex uses structural anchors with proximity constraints to match
  domain-specific content. Corroborative evidence: 7 keywords within 300 characters. Keyword lists:
  au-healthcare-records.
pattern: >-
  (?is)\b(patient|clinical|diagnostic|laboratory|medication|treatment|pathology|imaging|consent|adverse\s+event|biometric|genomic|hiv)\b.{0,240}\b(record|result|history|plan|report|note|status|encounter)\b
confidence: medium
confidence_justification: identifier/document-structure anchored regex with constrained context replaces phrase-only detection.

      identifiers such as medical record numbers or dates of birth.
