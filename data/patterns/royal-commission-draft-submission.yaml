description: Detects draft submissions to Royal Commissions before formal tabling. Pre-tabling drafts reveal the State's narrative
  strategy, admissions under consideration, and positions not yet finalised. Disclosure prejudices the State's participation
  in proceedings of national significance.
operation: 'Primary detection: keyword proximity matching ''Royal Commission'' within 200 characters of draft/submission terms
  (''draft submission'', ''draft response'', ''proposed submission'', ''submission for approval''). Document marker detection:
  ''DRAFT'' + ''Royal Commission'' + (''PROTECTED'' or ''CONFIDENTIAL'' or ''NOT FOR PUBLICATION''). Exclusion: negative match
  on ''tabled'', ''published'', ''public version''. Corroborative evidence: 3 keywords within 300 characters.'
pattern: (?i)\bRoyal\s+Commission\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: Royal Commission + DRAFT/submission + PROTECTED markers is a narrow, precise combination.
  Exclusion of published/tabled versions effectively eliminates public document false positives.'
