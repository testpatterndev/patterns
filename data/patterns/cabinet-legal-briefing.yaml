description: 'Detects legal annexures to Cabinet submissions containing privileged legal analysis supporting Cabinet decision-making.
  These documents carry dual protection: Cabinet confidentiality (Westminster convention) and legal professional privilege.
  Disclosure breaches both simultaneously with no remediation possible.'
operation: 'Primary detection: keyword proximity matching ''Cabinet'' within 150 characters of legal indicators (''legal advice'',
  ''legal briefing'', ''legal risk'', ''legal annexure'', ''privilege''). Document marker detection: ''CABINET-IN-CONFIDENCE''
  combined with ''LEGAL'', ''LPP'', ''PRIVILEGE'', or ''Legal-Privilege''. Corroborative evidence: 3 keywords within 300 characters.'
pattern: (?i)\bCabinet\b
confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: The combination of Cabinet + legal privilege terminology is highly specific to
  government legal practice. Document markers (CABINET-IN-CONFIDENCE + legal terms) provide near-certain identification. False
  positives from furniture references eliminated by legal keyword proximity requirement.'
