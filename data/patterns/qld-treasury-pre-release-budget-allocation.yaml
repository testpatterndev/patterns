description: Detects unreleased Queensland state budget allocation figures, forward estimates, and expenditure projections.
  These are market-moving documents that enable insider trading on government-linked securities if disclosed prematurely.
operation: 'Keyword proximity: primary financial keywords (budget, forward estimates, appropriation) within 300 characters
  of Treasury context keywords (Queensland Treasury, QTC, CBRC) and dollar amounts or allocation terms. Requires pre-release
  markers (draft, pre-release, not for distribution, PROTECTED).'
pattern: \$[\d,.]+\s*[MBKmb]?
confidence: high
confidence_justification: 'High confidence: co-occurrence of Treasury-specific terms with pre-release markers and dollar amounts
  in a document context makes false positives unlikely. Published budget documents are excluded by negative keywords.'
